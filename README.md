# maximum-learning-device

A Python program for smart glasses intended to maximize learning rate by reviewing in perfect accordance with spaced repetition.

## Vision
It's seemed to me that for those self-studying at a near-maximal quantity, a device that enables one to study in perfect accordance with spaced repetition would be highly useful. The form of the smart glasses enables one to review discretely and whenever. I believe this project, seen to its end, will have a multiplicative effect on my learning rate, and I so intend for other students.
